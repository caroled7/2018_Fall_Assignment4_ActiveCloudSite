Carole notes:  I have created a simplified version of app.  If you already had run app on your laptop, you will need to delete the IEXTrading database because this version has new fields for the company table.
Currently, the app allows you to retrieve symbols and save them to the database - but only 10 at a time.  I will work to improve this.
In the meantime, you still have the formatted fields you need to create any algorithm you want.
